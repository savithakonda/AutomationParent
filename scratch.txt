What do we do in Automation:
- We expediate the process
    - By optimizing the reusable work flows
    - Creating scripts to reuse
    Manual Time to execute      Automation: Time to execute
    - Test Case creation        - Test case optimization
    - Test Data creation        - Script creation
    - Test Case validation      - Script execution
    - Execution                 - Validation

When to automate:
- Calculate the Return on Investment (ROI)
    - Amount of test cases
    - Amount of Regression
    - Duration of the project
    - Frequency of changes coming in the application
    - Complexity in automtating the workflows

How do we automate:
- We mimic the workflow
    By using some tool or code based scripts

Actions that are possible:
- Type the data in text fields
- Click on buttons, links or checkboxes or radio buttons
- Select values from drop down fields
- Validations

Selenium:
Its a web application automation tool
- It can operate only on Browsers
- It has close dependencies on the Browser Versions
- Selenium controls the instances of every session
- Session sharing is not possible in Selenium
- Every session starts with a new Browser
- It cannot validation/automate any Media stuff like images, videos, flash, silverlight(old)
- Selenium can be executed in multiple programming languages
    Java, C#, phyton, ruby....

Java:
Setup - environmental values

Basics:
- variables
- loops, conditional statmemnets
- functions - 4 varients
- oops concepts
- integration with tools like log4j, io - property files, xml files, xls files
- Introduction to maven and setting up maven projects
- Detailed understanding of maven conecpts like plugins, dependencies, profiles, modules...
- integration with TestNg, Junit
- integration with Cucumber
- Custom screenshot with java and selenium

- Integration with Selenium
- Different versions.
- Chrome browser for examples

Git, Trello

Build a framework - data driven or keyword driven
--------------------------
Day 1:
Github setup:
1. Installed git.exe on windows
2. Verifeid that git plugin is enabled on intellij
3. Created a new project parent
4. Added module to the parent
5. Committed the projects
    - Add to git hub by selecting
            VCS > Import into github > Share project on github
    - Connection to github by providing the credentials
    - Verified that git remote url is available on
            VCS > Git > Remote option
6. Push the files to the Remote github

Verification: Open github and we see the project pom files and the new project on remote repository

Created a new Branch on Git and
    Created a HelloWorld class
        - Observed the difference between .java and .class files
        - Target folder
    Executed the first java class and seen the output
------------
+ is called as Concatenation operator (ex: "Mr." + "Peter" )
+ is a math operator (5 + 5)
+ is called as Concatenation operator - ("Rs: " + 5) ==> Rs: 5
/ -> can be used as divide as well as escape charater

Function/method:
    A set of lines of code which can be referred with a specific name
    -TIP:  name of the function/method represents the action/logic thats being perofrmed
    Purpose: to reuse the logic/code
    We can refer to the function/mehtod any number of times.. This will execute that particular block of lines.
    This will minimize the duplicate code lines through out the project

    Default Method in java is

    Reason: This defines the start point of the execution
    - This is predefined in jvm

    <access Specifier> <static/non-static> <returnTye> <nameOfMethod> (<optional - input parameters>) { -- }
    public static void main

 1. Access Specifier: public/private/protected
 2. static/non-static: static/<null>
 3. returnType: void --> no return value
                any data type like int, String, char, boolean....
 4. Name of the method - Should be unique in the scope of a class
                        Should not be matching with any predefined keywords
 5. Input parameter - this is the input we pass to the function/method
                        can be any data type
                        Can be empty also -- > no input parameter

    No Input parameter - no return value
    Input parameter - no return value
    no Input parameter - with return value
    with input paramter  - with return value

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
     /*   int a=10;
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(a);
      Variable obj=new Variable();
        System.out.println(obj.b);
        // call the function sayHi
        */

     // calling a method called sayHi
     /* sayHi();
        // calling a method called addition - with input parameters
        addition(5, 7);
        addition(1, 11);
        addition(2, 66);
        addition(6, 88);

        // declare a new variable
        // and assign the value coming from the function with return type
   */

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- Naming conventions
    Names cannot start with any numbers or special charactes
    - always starts with alpha character
    - no special characters are allowed in the variable names.
        ex: num1    - valid
            num%    - invalid
            1num    - invalid
            num€vv  - invalid
            _num1   - invalid
            n1um    - valid

    1. Project
        - Name starts with a capital and follow camel casing
    2. module
        - Name starts with a capital and follow camel casing
    3. Packages
        - Name starts with a small letter and follow camel casing
    4. Class
        - Name starts with a capital and follow camel casing
    7. objects - instance variable
        - Name starts with a small letter
        + name is (in most cases) equal to the class name
    5. methods
        - Name starts with a small letter and follow camel Casing
        ex: getProductOfTwoNumbers()
    6. variables
        - Name starts with a small letter and follow camel Casing
        - Constants: they will not change through out. These are always in ALL CAPITALS
            COUNTRY = "US";
            ORGANISATION = "DXC";
            ONE = 1;
        - thisIsAVariable
        - thisIsClassObject;








Now: Commit the new class file to the remote



Functions:

                        static                      non-static
static member             yes                         yes. with the help of an object
non static member          yes                         yes

Conditional Expressions:

=   assignation operator
==  comparision operator (equals to)
>=  comparision operator (Greater than or equal to)
>   greater than
<   less than
<=  less than or equal to
!=  not equal to

!   ==> negation operator
&& ==> AND operator
||  ==> OR Operator

AND Table:          OR Table:
T AND T == T        T OR T  == T
T AND F == F        T OR F  == T
F AND T == F        F OR T  == T
F AND F == T        F OR F  == F



Task: comparision between 3 numbers
1. use nested if conditions
a < b
    a < c
        b < c

Escape Sequence:
\t  - Tab space
\n  - New line character
\\  - To use slash
\"  - to print/use "
\'  - to print/use '



------------

Set<DataType>
    - similar to List<DataType>
            Where DataType is any of Strin/int/custom defined data type
    Only difference between List and Set is:
        List accepts duplicate entries
        Set doesn't accept any duplicate entry

To iterate on any collection we can use ForEach syntax


for(DataType loopVariable: collectionVariable) {

}

Where Data Type is the List/Set collection type
collectionVariable is a variable storing the list/set (others also: hashset, map, hashmap)

break:
------
Break keyword is used to terminate the loop whener a certain condition is met


//TODO: Check private access specifier
//TODO: String functions - Done
//TODO: Finally keyword
